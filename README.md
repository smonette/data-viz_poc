# Data Viz Proof of Concept

## Getting Started
These instructions assume a level of comfort using the command line.

*Before you start:* Make sure the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your machine. If you aren't sure, open command line and type `node -v` to check. To install, follow the [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) instructions then confirm by running `node -v`

* Clone this repo to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/smonette/data-viz_poc.git`

* Install required packages: `npm install`
This will create a folder in your project called `node_modules` where it installs any dependencies that are required in the `package.json`

* Start up the app: `npm start`. This will get the app running.

* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Common Pitfalls
If your project is erroring, confirm that all the packages in the `package.json` have been installed into `node_modules`
