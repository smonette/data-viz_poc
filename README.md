# Data Viz Proof of Concept

## Getting Started
These instructions assume a level of comfort using the command line. On a Mac you can use the built in Terminal, and on a PC you have Command Prompt. You can simply use the code in the directions, and hit enter.

*Before you start:* Make sure the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your machine. If you aren't sure, open command line and type `node -v` to check. To install, follow the [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) instructions then confirm by running `node -v`

1. Clone this repo to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/smonette/data-viz_poc.git`

2. Install required packages: `npm install`
This will create a folder in your project called "node_modules" where it installs any dependencies that are required in the "package.json".

3. Start up the app: `npm start`. This will get the app running.

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Common Pitfalls
If your project is erroring, some good steps are: 
* confirming that all the packages in the `package.json` have been installed into `node_modules`.
* checking how old your version of Node is. At this writing v4.4.5 is the most current
